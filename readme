Woofractal(GPU) is a continuation of a development effort that originally started out using a CPU raytracing engine, Wootracer. That engine is still available on github, but this one now uses GPU rendering instead.

Current release is v0.97, i.e. very close to final. Outstanding at time of writing is better control of atmospherics + an upgraded colour selection.

Getting Started)
- Open the application.
- Select a fractal you like from the 6 boxes in "HYBRIDISE".
- Move some sliders
- Move the camera around using arrow keys (hold Ctrl for up/down, Shift for fine control)
- Click final render
- Click start
- Move sliders until you get an image you like
- Click Save
- Share on twitter/instagram/etc. and tag #woofractal
